Fundamentals section of the Q DSP library provides a brief overview of the basic features of the library, including layering and dependencies, file structure, namespace, function objects as fundamental building blocks, rich data types, and user-defined literals. The Q library comprises of two layers: q_io: Audio and MIDI I/O layer. The q_io layer provides cross-platform audio and MIDI host connectivity straight out of the box. The q_io layer is optional. The q_lib layer is usable without it. q_lib: The core DSP library, q_lib is a no-frills, lightweight, header-only library. The dependencies are determined by the arrows. q_io has very minimal dependencies (portaudio and portmidi) with very loose coupling via thin wrappers that are easy to transplant and port to a host, with or without an operating system, such as an audio plugin or direct to hardware ADC and DAC. q_io is used in the tests and examples, but can be easily replaced by other mechanisms in an application. DAW (digital audio workstations), for example, have their own audio and MIDI I/O mechanisms. q_lib has no dependencies except the standard c++ library. The library is organized with this simplified directory structure: docs (1) example (2) q_io ├─ external (3) ├─ include (4) └─ src (5) q_lib └─ include (6) test (7) 1 Where this documentation resides. 2 Self-contained and easy to understand c++ programs that demonstrate various features of the library. 3 3rd party libraries used by the q_io module. 4 q_io header files. 5 q_io source files. 6 Header-only core q_lib DSP library. 7 A comprehensive set of c++ files for testing the library. Other sub-directories not listed here can be ignored. The q_lib module, header-only core, has this simplified directory structure: q_lib └─ include └─ q ├─ fft (1) ├─ fx (2) ├─ pitch (3) ├─ support (4) ├─ synth (5) └─ utility (6) 1 Fast fourier transform. 2 Various \"effects\" processor building blocks. 3 Pitch detection related facilities. 4 Fundamental support facilities. 5 Various synthesisers. 6 Auxiliary utility functions and classes. Other sub-directories not listed here can be ignored. All entities in the Q library are placed in namespace cycfi::q. Everywhere in this documentation, we will be using a namespace alias to make the code less verbose: namespace q = cycfi::q; Typical audio processors in the Q DSP library work on floating point input samples with the normal -1.0 to 1.0 range. However, values are not limited to sampled signals. For instance, signal envelopes are best represented as decibels that are processed in the logarithmic domain, so dynamic-range processors such as compressors and expanders accept decibel as input and return decibel as output. For example: decibel gain = comp(env); comp is a compressor. The compressor above, however, processes signal envelopes rather than raw samples, in contrast to the typical implementation of DSP compressors. The compressor above accepts an envelope represented by decibel, performs computation in the logarithmic domain, and returns a compressed envelope also represented by decibel. Oscillators, as another example, operate on phase-angle inputs and return output samples: float out = sin(phase++); The Q DSP library has a rich set of such types: float and double Typical sample data type -1.0 to 1.0 (or beyond for some computational headroom). frequency Cycles per second (Hz). duration A time span (seconds, milliseconds, etc.) period The inverse of frequency. phase Fixed point 1.31 format where 31 bits are fractional. phase. represents 0 to 2π phase values suitable for oscillators. decibel Ratio of one value to another on a logarithmic scale (dB). For more information, see Units. The Q DSP library is typeful and typesafe. You can not mismatch values of different types such as frequency and decibel, for example. Such potentially disastrous mistakes can happen if all values are just raw floating point types. There are conversions to and from these data types where it is reasonable to do so. decibel can, for example, be converted to 'float' or 'double' using the as_float or as_double conversion functions. Example: float gain = as_float(12_dB); Relational operations are allowed. For example: if (gain > 3_dB) // 3_dB is a decibel literal (see below) s = lp(s); Arithmetic operations are allowed. For example: auto total_duration = 3_ms + 5_ms; // 3_ms and 5_ms are duration literals Where appropriate, arithmetic with raw types are allowed. For example: auto harmonic = 440_Hz * 4; // 440_Hz is a frequency literal To augment the wealth of value types, the Q DSP library makes abundant use of user-defined literals. We take advantage of C++ type safe user-defined literals, instead of the usual float or double which can be unsafe when values of different units (e.g. frequency vs. duration) are mismatched. The Q DSP library makes abundant use of user-defined literals for units such as time, frequency and volume. For example, we use 24_dB, instead of a unit-less 24 or worse, a non-intuitive, unit-less 15.8 —the gain equivalent of 24_dB. Such constants also make the code very readable, another objective of this library. Q Literals are placed in the namespace q::literals. The namespace is sparse enough to be hoisted into your namespace using using namespace: To use these literals, include the literals.hpp header: #include then use the literals namespace somewhere in a scope where you need it: using namespace q::literals; Here are some example expressions: 82.4069_Hz 440_Hz 1.5_KHz 1.5_kHz 1_kHz 0.5_MHz 3_MHz 10.3_s 1_s 20.5_ms 1_ms 10.5_us 500_us -3.5_dB 10_dB 2_pi 0.5_pi Here’s the list of available literals: // frequency constexpr frequency operator \"\" _Hz(long double val); constexpr frequency operator \"\" _Hz(unsigned long long int val); constexpr frequency operator \"\" _KHz(long double val); constexpr frequency operator \"\" _KHz(unsigned long long int val); constexpr frequency operator \"\" _kHz(long double val); constexpr frequency operator \"\" _kHz(unsigned long long int val); constexpr frequency operator \"\" _MHz(long double val); constexpr frequency operator \"\" _MHz(unsigned long long int val); // duration constexpr duration operator \"\" _s(long double val); constexpr duration operator \"\" _s(unsigned long long int val); constexpr duration operator \"\" _ms(long double val); constexpr duration operator \"\" _ms(unsigned long long int val); constexpr duration operator \"\" _us(long double val); constexpr duration operator \"\" _us(unsigned long long int val); // decibel constexpr decibel operator \"\" _dB(unsigned long long int val); constexpr decibel operator \"\" _dB(long double val); // pi constexpr long double operator \"\" _pi(long double val); constexpr long double operator \"\" _pi(unsigned long long int val) In the realm of electronic music, there are processors and synthesizers, whose definitions overlap somewhat and differ primarily in how they handle input and output. The processor receives one or more input samples and generates one or more output samples according to a specific processing algorithm. A synthesizer, on the other hand, generates sound from scratch without using any samples. The C++ function object is the most basic building block. In the Q world, both processors and synthesizers are simply function objects, which can be composed to form more complex functions. A function object can accept zero or more input values and generate zero or more output values. Function objects are instantiated from struct or class declarations in the header files. In this example, we instantiate hypothetical f_x and g_x structs: auto f = f_x{}; auto g = g_x{}; Syntactically, you can use these function objects just like any other function. Here’s an example function call invocation for the single input function object, f instantiated above: float r = f(s); where s is the input value, and f(s) returns a result and stores it in the variable r. Composition by passing the result of f to g, like this: float r = g(f(s)); can be encapsulated using function composition in a class or struct: struct fg_x { float operator()(float s) const { return g(f(s)); } f_x f; g_x g; }; Here, we encapsulate f_x and g_x inside the composed function object struct fg_x. We can then instantiate a function object for fg_x just like we would above. The Q DSP library uses fine-grained and reusable function object structs or classes like this. Such reusable components are composed to form more powerful higher level composites. Here’s the code example in the library for signal conditioning: inline float signal_conditioner::operator()(float s) { // High pass s = _hp(s); (1) // Pre clip s = _clip(s); (2) // Dynamic Smoother s = _sm(s); (3) // Signal envelope auto env = _env(std::abs(s)); (4) // Noise gate auto gate = _gate(env); (5) s *= _gate_env(gate); (6) // Compressor + makeup-gain auto env_db = decibel(env); auto gain = as_float(_comp(env_db)) * _makeup_gain; (7) s = s * gain; _post_env = env * gain; return s; } We’re showing only the operator() for brevity. But take note that the code uses multiple function objects for various processing functions that correspond to these class member variables: private: clip _clip; (2) highpass _hp; (1) dynamic_smoother _sm; (3) fast_envelope_follower _env; (4) float _post_env; compressor _comp; (7) float _makeup_gain; onset_gate _gate; (5) envelope_follower _gate_env; (6) }; The complete code can be found here: signal_conditioner.hpp Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Joel de Guzman.

The full example can be found here: example/delay.cpp. The example loads a pre-recorded wav file and plays it back with processing. The raw audio source will be played in the left channel while the delayed signal will be played in the right channel. Pretty much as straightforward as possible. The audio will be played using the currently selected audio device. The final audio output can be heard below: Your browser does not support the audio tag. // fractional delay (1) q::delay _delay{350_ms, 44100}; // Mix the signal s, and the delayed signal (where s is the incoming sample) (2) auto _y = s + _delay(); // Feed back the result to the delay (2) _delay.push(_y * _feedback); Normally, there will be a processing loop that receives the incoming samples, s. The code above are placed: 1 Before the processing loop. 2 Inside inside the processing loop. Typically, you encapsulate the code inside a class where _delay, _y and _feedback are member variables. 44100 is the desired sampling rate. _feedback is the amount of feedback desired (anything from 0.0 to less than 1.0, e.g. 0.85). 350_ms is the delay duration. Take note of 350_ms. Here, we take advantage of C++ type safe user-defined literals, instead of the usual float or double which can be unsafe when values of different units (e.g. frequency vs. duration) are mismatched. The Q DSP library makes abundant use of user-defined literals for units such as time, frequency and volume. For example, we use 24_dB, instead of a unit-less 24 or worse, a non-intuitive, unit-less 15.8 —the gain equivalent of 24_dB. Such constants also make the code very readable, another objective of this library. Processors such as q::delay are C++ function objects that can be composed to form more complex processors. For example if you want to filter the delayed signal with a low-pass filter with a 1 kHz cutoff frequency, you apply the q::lowpass filter over the result of the delay: q::lowpass _lp{1_kHz, 44100}; then insert the filter where it is needed in the processing loop: // Add the signal s, and the delayed, low-pass filtered signal auto _y = s + _lp(_delay()); Let us move on to a more elaborate example. How about a fully functional, bandwidth limited square wave synthesizer with ADSR envelope that controls an amplifier and a resonant filter and control the note-on and note-off using MIDI? Sounds good? This example is complete and self-contained in one .cpp file, kept as simple as possible to highlight the ease-of-use. The full example can be found here: example/square_synth.cpp. In order to run this example, you will need a MIDI input device connected to your system, preferrably a keyboard. Make sure you have at least one installed. If you do not have a physical MIDI input device, you can install one of the MIDI onscreen keyboards. For example, MidiKeys is a small application for MacOS that presents a MIDI keyboard onscreen. Here’s a short video clip: After building the program, make sure you have a MIDI keyboard connected before starting the application. At startup, the app will present you with a list of available MIDI hardware and will ask you what you want to use. Example: ================================================================================ Available MIDI Devices (ID : \"Name\" inputs/outputs): 0 : \"Quantum 2626\" 1/0 1 : \"Code 61 USB MIDI\" 1/0 2 : \"Code 61 MIDI DIN\" 1/0 3 : \"Code 61 Mackie/HUI\" 1/0 4 : \"Code 61 Editor\" 1/0 5 : \"Quantum 2626\" 0/1 6 : \"Code 61 USB MIDI\" 0/1 7 : \"Code 61 MIDI DIN\" 0/1 8 : \"Code 61 Mackie/HUI\" 0/1 9 : \"Code 61 Editor\" 0/1 ================================================================================ Choose MIDI Device ID: 1 And then a list of audio devices to choose from. Example: ================================================================================ Available Audio Devices (ID : \"Name\" inputs/outputs): 1 : \"MacBook Air Microphone\" 1/0 2 : \"MacBook Air Speakers\" 0/2 3 : \"Quantum 2626\" 26/26 ================================================================================ Choose Audio Device ID: 3 Take note that the demo is a console application. The Q library does not have a GUI, for good reason! We want to keep it as simple as possible. The GUI is taken cared of by other libraries (e.g. Elements). After choosing the MIDI and Audio driver, the synth is playable. The synth is monophonic and responds to velocity only, for simplicity. There are more demo applications in the example directory. After this quick tutorial, feel free to explore. Here’s the actual synthesizer with the processing loop: struct my_square_synth : q::port_audio_stream { my_square_synth(q::adsr_envelope_gen::config env_cfg, int device_id) : port_audio_stream(q::audio_device::get(device_id), 0, 2) , env(env_cfg, this->sampling_rate()) , filter(0.5, 0.8) {} void process(out_channels const& out) { auto left = out[0]; auto right = out[1]; for (auto frame : out.frames()) { // Generate the ADSR envelope auto env_ = env() * velocity; // Set the filter frequency filter.cutoff(env_); // Synthesize the square wave auto val = q::square(phase++); // Apply the envelope (amplifier and filter) with soft clip val = clip(filter(val) * env_); // Output right[frame] = left[frame] = val; } } q::phase_iterator phase; // The phase iterator q::adsr_envelope_gen env; // The envelope generator q::reso_filter filter; // The resonant filter q::soft_clip clip; // Soft clip float velocity; // Note-on velocity }; Our synth, a subclass of q::port_audio_stream, sets up buffers for the input and output audio streams and presents those to our processing loop (the process function above). In this example, we setup an audio stream with the selected device, no inputs and two (stereo) outputs: port_audio_stream(q::audio_device::get(device_id), 0, 2) Behind the scenes, there’s a lot going on here, actually. But you will notice that emphasis is given to making the library very readable, easy to understand and follow by breaking down complex tasks into smaller manageable tasks and using function composition at progressively higher levels, while maintaining simplicity and clarity of intent. The synthesizer above is composed of smaller building blocks: fine grained C++ function objects. For example, here’s the square wave oscillator (bandwidth limited using poly_blep). For now, we will skim over details such as the adsr_envelope_gen, phase, and phase_iterator, and this thing called poly_blep. The important point, exemplified here, is that we want to keep our building blocks as simple and minimal as possible. We will cover these in greater detail later. The astute reader may notice that our square_osc class does not even have state! struct square_osc { constexpr float operator()(phase p, phase dt) const { constexpr auto middle = phase::middle(); auto r = p < middle ? 1.0f : -1.0f; // Correct rising discontinuity r += poly_blep(p, dt); // Correct falling discontinuity r -= poly_blep(p + middle, dt); return r; } constexpr float operator()(phase_iterator i) const { return (*this)(i._phase, i._incr); } }; constexpr auto square = square_osc{}; Yeah, that’s the complete oscillator. That’s all there is to it! The modern C++ savvy programmer will immediately notice the use of constexpr, applied judiciously all throughout the library. Such modern C++ facilities allow the compiler to generate extremely efficient code, even those that are generated at compile time. That means, for this example, that one can build an oscillator at compile time if needed, perhaps with constant wavetable results stored in read-only memory. The midi_processor takes care of MIDI events. Your application will have its own MIDI processor that deals with MIDI events that you are interested in. For this simple example, we simply want to process note-on and note-off events. On note-on events, our MIDI processor sets `my_square_synth’s note frequency and velocity and triggers its envelope for attack. On note-off events, our MIDI processor initiates the envelope’s release. struct my_midi_processor : midi::processor { using midi::processor::operator(); my_midi_processor(my_square_synth& synth) : _synth(synth) {} void operator()(midi::note_on msg, std::size_t time) { _key = msg.key(); auto freq = midi::note_frequency(_key); _synth.phase.set(freq, _synth.sampling_rate()); _synth.env.attack(); _synth.velocity = float(msg.velocity()) / 128; } void operator()(midi::note_off msg, std::size_t time) { if (msg.key() == _key) _synth.env.release(); } std::uint8_t _key; my_square_synth& _synth; }; In the main function, we instantiate my_square_synth and my_midi_processor. The synth constructor, in case you haven’t noticed yet, requires an envelope configuration (envelope::config). Here, we provide our configuration. Take note that in this example, the envelope parameters are constant, for the sake of simplicity, but you can definitely have these controllable by the user by writing your own MIDI processor that deals with MIDI control change messages. Again, take note of the abundant use of user-defined literals for units such as duration (e.g. 100_ms) and level (e.g. -12_dB). auto env_cfg = q::envelope::config { 100_ms // attack rate , 1_s // decay rate , -12_dB // sustain level , 5_s // sustain rate , 1_s // release rate }; my_square_synth synth{ env_cfg }; Then, we create my_midi_processor, giving it a reference to my_square_synth. We’ll also need a midi_input_stream that receives the actual incoming MIDI messages from the chosen hardware. q::midi_input_stream stream; my_midi_processor proc{ synth }; Now we’re all set. We start the synth and enter a loop that exits when the user presses ctrl-c (in which case the running flag becomes false). In the loop, we give our MIDI processor a chance to process incoming MIDI events as they arrive from the MIDI stream: synth.start(); while (running) stream.process(proc); synth.stop(); Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Joel de Guzman.

The dynamic range of an audio signal is the difference between its loudest and quietest components. Compression, Expansion, Limiting, and Gating are a few common types of dynamic range processing used in audio DSP. Such processing can enhance sound quality, minimize or eliminate noise, and create creative effects. The dynamic range processors in the Q DSP library are unique in that they do not process audio waveform samples directly. Instead, they operate on the envelope of the audio signal, represented as decibel, perform computations in the logarithmic domain, and return a processed envelope, also represented as decibel. As an example, here’s the processing code for the compressor: decibel compressor::operator()(decibel env) const { if (env <= _threshold) return 0_dB; return _slope * (_threshold - env); } This is a hard knee compressor: a type of compressor in which the compression ratio changes abruptly when the input signal exceeds the threshold level, known as the knee point. Both hard knee and soft knee compressors are supported by the Q DSP library. The code accepts an envelope input, env, in decibels and outputs a compressed envelope also in decibels. Processing is done in the logarithmic domain, where addition of two values is equivalent to multiplying their corresponding linear values, and multiplication of two values is equivalent to raising their corresponding linear values to a power. The envelope follower, which is responsible for generating the input envelope for the compressor, is implemented outside of the compressor class. The objective is separation of concerns and the flexibility to use various envelope followers. Compared to their linear counterparts, performing computations in the logarithmic domain is simpler, more intuitive, and makes the code easier to understand while maintaining the same level of efficiency. The compressor example above and all dynamic range processors in the Q DSP library are essentially envelope processors. They receive envelopes, process envelopes, and return envelopes. Since envelope processors operate on the envelope, perform computations in the logarithmic domain, and return a processed envelope, multiple envelope processors can be cascaded. For instance, you can use a single envelope follower and apply the derived envelope to an expander and then pass the result to a compressor, like in the diagram below: A specific use-case for cascading an expander and a compressor, like in the example above, is when you want to use the expander as a noise gate, with soft, non-abrupt gating, set at a threshold just above the noise floor. Then, setting the threshold of the compressor to a high value to even out the dynamic range. The compressor and expander in this case work on different regions of the full dynamic range. But there are also useful cases where the overlap of dynamic ranges the processors are working on is advantageous. The compressor-limiter is a good example. Likewise, multiple compressors with variable thresholds and ratios are another example. By cascading multiple dynamic range processors, we can design efficient multi-function processors like the compressor-limiter with gate (transfer response graph at the right).","title":"Dynamic","component":"q","version":"develop-0.99","name":"dynamic","url":"/q/develop-0.99/reference/dynamic.html","titles":[{"text":"Overview","hash":"_overview","id":1},{"text":"Example","hash":"_example","id":2},{"text":"Key Points","hash":"_key_points","id":3},{"text":"Cascading","hash":"_cascading","id":4}]},"8":{"id":8,"text":"This section deals with envelope extraction from signals. In audio DSP, an envelope efers to the time-varying changes of a signal. It essentially represents the \"shape\" of the signal in terms of its moment-to-moment changes. Extracting an envelope from a signal is particularly important because they can be used for a variety of processing tasks, including controlling the perceived loudness of a signal, reducing noise, emphasizing particular elements of the signal, modulating amplitude, frequency, and other sound properties, to name a few. Envelopes are typically, but not always, related to amplitude changes, although it can sometimes be related to other parameters like pitch or frequency, phase, and filter cutoff, to name a few. This section will only cover amplitude envelope extraction. Figure 1. Output behavior of different types of envelope followers. The amplitude envelope can also be used to extract dynamic features from a sound. As an example, onset detection is a method for determining the beginning of each musical note. The most basic onset detection scheme involves analyzing the amplitude envelope and detecting sudden changes in amplitude that coincide with the start of each note. [1] The Q DSP library includes a variety of envelope extractors, ranging from the most basic peak envelope follower to the more precise, but computationally demanding, fast RMS envelope follower. Each has distinct strengths, characteristics, and tradeoffs that can be evaluated based on the application’s specific requirements. Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Joel de Guzman. All rights reserved.

This level of control enables users to create expressive and unique sounds that can be used in a variety of contexts, ranging from music production to sound design for film and video games. The advancements in DSP technology have made synthesizers even more powerful and flexible. Users can now create sounds that were previously impossible to achieve with traditional analog synthesizers. The Q DSP library provides some common synthesisers such as sine-wave, square, pulse, triangle and saw-tooth, as well as various generators for sculpting the sound envelopes with controls for attack, decay, hold sustain and release. These are designed as moduler building blocks that are combined to form more complex synthesisers. Oscillator is a concept representation of an oscillator that generates periodic waveforms. Oscillators are function objects that take in a phase_iterator: an iterator over the phase. The output is typically a floating point value. namespace cycfi::q::concepts { template concept Oscillator = std::copy_constructible && std::assignable_from && std::default_initializable && requires(T o, T a, T b, phase_iterator pi) { o(pi); // Generate a periodic waveform given `{phase_iterator}`, `pi`. }; } o, a, b Instances of Oscillator. pi Object of type phase_iterator. Expression Semantics Oscillator() Default construct an Oscillator. Oscillator(o) Copy construct from o. a = b Assign b to a. C++ brace initialization may also be used. Expression Semantics Return Type o(pi) Generate a periodic waveform given phase_iterator, pi. decltype(o(pi)) BasicOscillator is a refinement of the Oscillator concept. BasicOscillator is not bandwidth limited. This is is suitable in certain cases. Moreover, some oscillators are inherently bandwidth limited. namespace cycfi::q::concepts { template concept BasicOscillator = Oscillator && requires(T o, phase ph) { o(ph); // Generate a periodic waveform given `{phase}`, `pi`. }; } In addition to valid expressions for Oscillator, BasicOscillator allows these expressions. o Instance of BasicOscillator. ph Object of type phase. Expression Semantics Return Type o(ph) Generate a periodic waveform given phase, ph. decltype(o(ph)) Waveforms with hard discontinuities such as sawtooth and square waves can generate harmonics that extend beyond the Nyquist frequency range or half the sampling rate. Oscillators may be bandwidth limited to ensure that the harmonics generated fall within the Nyquist frequency range to prevent aliasing, which causes unwanted spectral artifacts in the signal. BandwidthLimitedOscillator is a refinement of the Oscillator concept. These oscillators are bandwidth limited. namespace cycfi::q::concepts { template concept BandwidthLimitedOscillator = Oscillator && requires(T o, phase ph, phase dt) { o(ph, dt); // Generate a periodic waveform given `{phase}`, `pi` // and another `{phase}`, `dt` representing the delta // phase between two samples of the waveform (this is // equivalent to the `_step` member function of the // `{phase_iterator}`).

Generators are function objects that take no function arguments and return an output that is typically a floating point value. Generators are typically non-periodic. Generators are useful for constructing complex signals, envelopes and tapers (also known as window functions). namespace cycfi::q::concepts { template concept Generator = requires(T v, T o, T a, T b, phase_iterator pi) { T(o); // Copy construct from `o`. a = b; // Assign `b` to `a`. v(); // Generate a signal. }; } g, a, b Instances of Generator. Expression Semantics Generator(g) Copy construct from g. a = b Assign b to a. C++ brace initialization may also be used. Expression Semantics Return Type g() Generate a signal. decltype(g(pi)) Ramp is a concept representation of a generator that generates non-periodic signals from 0.0 to 1.0 or from 1.0 to 0.0. It is a refinement of the Generator concept. Ramp`s are suitable for generating envelopes. A `Ramp represents a segment of an envelope. Essentially, an envelope comprises two or more upward and downward `Ramp`s. namespace cycfi::q::concepts { template concept Ramp = Generator && requires(T v, duration w, float sps) { T(w, sps); // Construct a Ramp given duration, w, and sps. v.reset(); // Reset the Ramp to the start. v.config(w, sps); // Configure a Ramp given duration, w, and sps. }; } In addition to valid expressions for Generator, Ramp allows these expressions. r Instance of Ramp. w Object of type duration. sps Floating point value representing samples per second. Expression Semantics Ramp(w, sps) Construct a Ramp given duration, w, and sps. C++ brace initialization may also be used.

These processors typically operate with floating-point input samples in the typical -1.0 to 1.0 range. However, the values are not restricted to sampled signals. For instance, signal envelopes are best represented as decibels processed in the logarithmic domain. Consequently, dynamic-range processors such as compressors and expanders accept decibel as input and return decibel as output. The Q DSP library is typeful and typesafe, which means that each data type is explicitly defined and enforced. This is crucial because it avoids the potentially catastrophic errors that could result from mismatching values of different types. For example, if all values were just raw floating point types, it would be possible to accidentally mix up the frequency and decibel values. Mistakenly interchanging frequency and decibel values could result in erroneous processing of the audio signal and will lead to undefined results. This document aims to provide comprehensive documentation of the fundamental data types used by the Q DSP library. These basic units are utilized consistently throughout the library and serve as the basis for quantifying specific parameters, such as decibels (dB) for signal level and hertz (Hz) for frequency.

The compressor can be utilized as a limiter by setting its threshold to the desired limit level and the ratio to a high value (e.g. 10:1 or greater).

Both hard knee and soft knee compressors are supported by the Q DSP library. #include struct compressor { compressor(decibel threshold, float ratio); decibel operator()(decibel env) const; void threshold(decibel val); void ratio(float ratio); decibel threshold() const; float ratio() const; }; comp, a, b Objects of type compressor t, env Objects of type decibel r Floating point value for compression ratio.

C++ brace initialization may also be used. The ratio parameter, r, specifies the amount of gain applied. With the typical \"n:1\" notation for compressors, the ratio parameter is 1/n, thereby the ratio for compressors is normally from 0.0…​1.0. For example, a 4:1 compression is 1/4 or 0.25. Signal rising above the threshold is attenuated, compressing the signal. For every dB above the threshold, t, the signal is attenuated by n dB.

The expander dynamically modulates the gain when the signal falls below the threshold, attenuating the signal. The expander is used to increase the dynamic range of an audio signal by reducing the level of low-level signals (signals below the threshold) while leaving high-level signals unchanged, in contrast to a compressor, which reduces the level of high-level signals while leaving low-level signals unchanged. A certain type of expander, called the downward expander, is implemented by a class named expander. The expander can be utilized as a noise gate by setting the threshold to allow only audio signals above the noise floor to pass through. When the audio level falls below the threshold, the expander effectively gates out any low-level noise by reducing the audio signal level down to zero. The result can range from a hard and sudden cutoff to a soft and gradual reduction of signals below the threshold, depending on the desired ratio. Envelope tracking is done externally using an external envelope follower to make it possible to use different types of envelope tracking schemes, the output of which is the supplied argument to the function call operator.

During the attack phase of an audio signal, the AR envelope follower attempts to follow the signal but is constrained by the attack duration. A longer attack period gives a softer response, exponentially increasing. When the signal level drops below the peak, the follower gradually releases the peak level with an exponential decay. The AR envelope follower models the behavior of two resistors, one for attack, and one for release, each connected in series with an ideal diode —with no voltage drop—, tied together and connected to a capacitor. During attacks, the capacitor charges through the attack resistor, exponentially increasing. The capacitor discharges through the release resistor as the audio signal falls below the peak charge, causing the output voltage to progressively decay with an exponential curve. Figure 1.

The interval between the initial signal and the repetitions is altered by adjusting the delay time. Longer durations provide echoes, whereas shorter delays produce doubling effects. Filters can shape the repeating signals, influencing their tonal properties. Delays are also essential for modulation effects such as flangers and choruses, which are created by dynamically modulating delay times using low-frequency oscillators (LFOs). basic_delay is a basic class for delays. The actual delay duration parameter is decoupled from, and managed outside the class to allow both single and multi-tapped delays. The delay is implemented using a base ring buffer with provisions for non-fractional (exact) and fractional (sub-sample) indexing. Fractional element indexing is required for fractional delays that are not integer multiples of the sampling period. Figure 1.

The non-interleaved format is ideal for digital signal processing where it is necessary to perform operations on individual channels separately, often in parallel for maximum efficiency. As an example, the figure below shows the memory layout of a 4-channel non-interleaved format. Figure 1. 4 Channel Non-Interleaved Format A Multi-buffer can be conceptualized as a two-dimensional array. The first dimension in this representation corresponds to the samples (x-dimension), while the second dimension represents the channels (y-dimension). Essentially, you can access each individual sample using the two indices ch and i, where ch is the channel index and i is the sample index. mb[ch][i] Each dimension has a size which can be obtained this way: mb.size() // The number of channels mb[ch].size() // The number of frames per channel That way, you can iterate through the channels and samples this way: for (auto ch = 0; ch != mb.size() ++ch) { for (auto i = 0; i != mb[ch].size() ++i) { auto s = mb[ch][i]; // Do something with the sample `s` } } Alternately, you can iterate through the channels and samples in a channel, using C++ range-based for loop syntax, as follows: for (auto ch : mb.channels) { for (auto i : mb.frames) { auto s = mb[ch][i]; // Do something with the sample `s` } } Take note that this syntax is unorthodox in the way it uses C++ range-based for loop syntax. Instead of accessing the channels and samples directly, mb.channels and mb.frames both return a range of indices (corresponding to 0..N, where N is number of channels, for mb.channels or samples, for mb.frames). The design rationale is to always allow random access to all channels and all samples for each channel. For example, you might want to access both the left and right channels of a stereo (2-channel) multi-buffer and mix them: auto left = mb[0]; auto right = mb[1]; for (auto i : mb.frames) { auto mono = right[i] + left[i]; // Add the left and right channels // Do something with `mono` } mb[ch] returns a view of the channel. It does not copy the whole buffer. This \"view\" is lightweight and can be held and passed by value without worrying about performance. The previous example can extend to an N channel mixer this way: for (auto i : mb.frames) { auto sum = 0.0f; for (auto ch : mb.channels) sum += mb[ch][i]; // Do something with `sum` } If you simply need sequential access to the samples in a channel, you can do it this way: for (auto ch : mb.channels) { for (auto s : mb[ch]) { // Do something with the sample `s` } } #include template class multi_buffer { public: using sample_type = T; using buffer_view = iterator_range; using frames_view = iterator_range; using channels_view = iterator_range; // Unspecified constructor buffer_view operator[](std::size_t channel) const; std::size_t size() const; frames_view frames; channels_view channels; }; multi_buffer is a template class that implements the multi-buffer.

Each segment is a Ramp that can be configured to have any conceivable shape. A few ramp shapes, including exponential, linear, blackman, and hann are provided.

There are four phases of interest: Idle phase: The output sits at zero while waiting for the next attack signal Ⓐ. Attack phase: Initiated when the attack signal Ⓐ is received, e.g. when a key is pressed. Intermediate phase: Starts after the attack phase and ends before the release phase. Release phase: Initiated when the release signal Ⓡ is received, e.g when the key is released. The envelope_gen waits for an attack signal Ⓐ while in the idle phase. As soon as an attack signal Ⓐ is received, the state immediately transitions to the attack phase. The output ramps up from 0.0 to the specified attack level, over the specified attack duration. The envelope gen is not retriggerable. Attack signals Ⓐ are only permitted during the idle phase. Any attack signal Ⓐ received outside of the idle phase is disregarded. Use one envelope_gen instance per note. This is most natural with polyphonic voicing, but can also apply to monophonic voicing. For monophonic voicing, on an incoming attack signal Ⓐ, active instances are sent release signals Ⓡ, a new instance is created, and its attack phase is initiated. The output will then be the maximum of all active instances. After the attack phase, anything that comes in between the attack phase and release phase are intermmediate phases that are sequenced by the envelope_gen, one after the other. Intermmediate phases may include the decay phase, the hold phase and the sustain phase. For each intermediate phase, the output ramps up or down from the previous level to the phase’s level over the phase’s duration. Upon receiving the release signal Ⓡ, the envelope_gen immediately transitions to the release phase. This may occur at any point during the attack or intermediate phases. The current phase may be cut short when this happens, and without delay, the output ramps down to 0.0 over the specified release duration. Typically, the last intermediate segment is configured with a very long duration (e.g. for sustain), and normally a release signal Ⓡ will occur long before the last intermediate segment ends. If that is not the case, like for example if the sustain segment is a relatively short linear down ramp, it is possible to transition to the release phase before a release signal Ⓡ is received. After completion of the release phase, the envelope_gen returns back to the idle state. Each envelope segment has parameters for width (the duration of the segment), level (the end level of the segment), and of course the Ramp type. A make_envelope_segment free function, templated on the ramp type, is provided for making segments. #include struct envelope_segment { envelope_segment(envelope_segment const&); envelope_segment& operator=(envelope_segment const&); void level(float level); void config(duration width, float sps); void config(float level, duration width, float sps); /*** Unspecified member functions ***/ }; template inline envelope_segment make_envelope_segment(duration width, float level, float sps); s, a, b Objects of type envelope_segment. w Object of type duration. l Floating point value representing level (0.0 to 1.0). sps Floating point value representing samples per second. T Ramp type. Expression Semantics envelope_segment(s) Copy construct from s. a = b Assign b to a. Expression Semantics Return Type make_envelope_segment( w, l, sps) Make an envelope segment with specified Ramp type, T, level, l, width, w, and samples per second, sps. envelope_segment // Make a 10 ms exponential segment with a peak level of 1.0. auto s = make_envelope_segment(10_ms, 1.0f, sps); Expression Semantics s.level(l) Set the segment level to l. s.config(w, sps) Set the segment width, w, with samples per second, sps. s.config(l, w, sps) Set the segment level, l, width, w, with samples per second, sps. The envelope generator is basically a container (std::vector) of envelope segments. Multiple segments with distinct shape characteristics may be used to construct ADSR envelopes, AD envelopes, etc. #include struct envelope_gen : std::vector { using base_type = std::vector; template envelope_gen(T&& ...arg); void attack(); void release(); float operator()(); void reset(); float current() const; bool in_idle_phase() const; bool in_attack_phase() const; bool in_release_phase() const; std::size_t index() const; }; As a subclass of std::vector, you can use all the facilities of std::vector to compose a multi-segment envelope generator of varying complexity. Take note of the single forwarding constructor that accepts variable arguments. Its purpose is to reset envelope_gen automatically after construction. All arguments are forwarded to the base class. envelope_gen is a subclass of std::vector and inherits all the publicly accessible member functions, member variables, and types of its base class. In addition to valid expressions for std::vector, envelope_gen allows these expressions. g Object of type envelope_gen. Expression Semantics Return Type g() Generate the next value. float Expression Semantics g.attack() Start the attack phase. g.release() Start the release phase. g.reset() Reset and move to the idle phase. Call envelope_gen::reset() whenever the segments change, such as when adding or removing segments from the segments container, to reset envelope_gen to the idle state. Expression Semantics Return Type g.current() Get the current level. float g.in_idle_phase() Return true if we are in the idle phase. bool g.in_attack_phase() Return true if we are in the attack phase. bool g.in_release_phase() Return true if we are in the release phase. bool g.index() Get the current index — the index of the latest active segment. std::size_t adsr_envelope_gen is a subclass of envelope_gen that offers specializations for generating envelopes of the ADSR type. This is a basic subclass that serves as a practical and prototypical envelope generator example. We will provide the full source code below, as an example of how to write an envelope generator. #include struct adsr_envelope_gen : envelope_gen { struct config { // Default settings duration attack_rate = 30_ms; duration decay_rate = 70_ms; decibel sustain_level = -6_dB; duration sustain_rate = 50_s; duration release_rate = 100_ms; }; adsr_envelope_gen(config const& config, float sps); void attack_rate(duration rate, float sps); void decay_rate(duration rate, float sps); void sustain_level(decibel level); void sustain_rate(duration rate, float sps); void release_rate(duration rate, float sps); }; inline adsr_envelope_gen::adsr_envelope_gen(config const& config_, float sps) : envelope_gen{ make_envelope_segment( config_.attack_rate, 1.0f, sps) // Attack (1) , make_envelope_segment( config_.decay_rate, lin_float(config_.sustain_level), sps) // Decay (2) , make_envelope_segment( config_.sustain_rate, 0.0f, sps) // Sustain (3) , make_envelope_segment( config_.release_rate, 0.0f, sps) // Release (4) } { } The config struct contains the constructor specifications for the ADSR paramneters, including attack_rate, decay_rate, sustain_level, sustain_rate, and release_rate. The user may specify these parameters like in this example: // Configure the adsr_envelope_gen auto env_cfg = q::adsr_envelope_gen::config { 300_ms // attack rate , 1_s // decay rate , -12_dB // sustain level , 5_s // sustain rate , 1_s // release rate }; // Instantiate an adsr_envelope_gen auto env_gen = q::adsr_envelope_gen{env_cfg, sps}; These parameters are used to construct the 4 segments comprising an ADSR envelope generator. Each of the segments are created using make_envelope_segment, passing in the Ramp type and the level, width, and samples per second. By defautl, the adsr_envelope_gen makes 4 segments with types: 1 exp_upward_ramp_gen for the attack segment, with peak level of 1.0. 2 exp_downward_ramp_gen for the decay segment, with level set to the sustain level. 3 lin_downward_ramp_gen for the sustain segment. This is a 5-second decaying linear ramp. 4 exp_downward_ramp_gen for the release segment, with level of 0.0. The remaining items are self-explanatory. These member functions permit the user to modify the five ADSR parameters following construction. The envelope segments are stored at indices 0 to 3 in the vector. // Set the attack rate inline void adsr_envelope_gen::attack_rate(duration rate, float sps) { (*this)[0].config(rate, sps); } // Set the decay rate inline void adsr_envelope_gen::decay_rate(duration rate, float sps) { (*this)[1].config(rate, sps); } // Set the sustain level inline void adsr_envelope_gen::sustain_level(decibel level) { (*this)[2].level(lin_float(level)); } // Set the sustain rate inline void adsr_envelope_gen::sustain_rate(duration rate, float sps) { (*this)[2].config(rate, sps); } // Set the release rate inline void adsr_envelope_gen::release_rate(duration rate, float sps) { (*this)[3].config(rate, sps); }","title":"Envelope Generator","component":"q","version":"develop-0.99","name":"envelope_gen","url":"/q/develop-0.99/reference/synth/envelope_gen.html","titles":[{"text":"Overview","hash":"_overview","id":1},{"text":"Phases and Transitions","hash":"_phases_and_transitions","id":2},{"text":"Envelope Segment","hash":"_envelope_segment","id":3},{"text":"Include","hash":"_include","id":4},{"text":"Declaration","hash":"_declaration","id":5},{"text":"Expressions","hash":"_expressions","id":6},{"text":"Notation","hash":"_notation","id":7},{"text":"Constructors and Assignment","hash":"_constructors_and_assignment","id":8},{"text":"Factory","hash":"_factory","id":9},{"text":"Example","hash":"_example","id":10},{"text":"Mutators","hash":"_mutators","id":11},{"text":"Envelope Generator","hash":"_envelope_generator","id":12},{"text":"Include","hash":"_include_2","id":13},{"text":"Declaration","hash":"_declaration_2","id":14},{"text":"Expressions","hash":"_expressions_2","id":15},{"text":"Notation","hash":"_notation_2","id":16},{"text":"Function Call","hash":"_function_call","id":17},{"text":"Operation","hash":"_operation","id":18},{"text":"Accessors","hash":"_accessors","id":19},{"text":"ADSR Envelope Generator","hash":"_adsr_envelope_generator","id":20},{"text":"Include","hash":"_include_3","id":21},{"text":"Declaration","hash":"_declaration_3","id":22},{"text":"Implementation","hash":"_implementation","id":23},{"text":"Constructor","hash":"_constructor","id":24},{"text":"Mutators","hash":"_mutators_2","id":25}]},"41":{"id":41,"text":"exp_upward_ramp_gen is an exponential upward ramp generator that generates an exponentially increasing amplitude from 0.0 to 1.0, similar to a capacitor charged by a series resistor over time specified by the duration (width) and samples per second (sps), and optional exponential curvature (cv) parameters. exp_downward_ramp_gen is the inverse of the exponential upward ramp generator.

In order to avoid further confusion, we will mark this constructor as deleted for the time being, making it a hard error to alert users upgrading to this library version. C++ brace initialization may also be used. Expression Semantics Return Type lin_float(d) Convert decibel to a linear value. float lin_double(d) Convert decibel to a linear value. double lin_to_db(v) Convert a linear value v to decibel. decibel approx_db(v) Faster approximate conversion from a linear value v to decibel. decibel The free function lin_to_db can be used to indirectly construct and return a decibel object from a linear value. The lin_to_db function performs linear to decibel conversion. Example: auto db = lin_to_db(2.0); // 6 dB In addition to lin_to_db, approx_db is another free function that performs linear to decibel conversion. It is a faster, but less accurate conversion function from a linear value to decibel. lin_float and lin_double convert decibel to a linear value with float and double results, respectively. If you need to create decibel from numeric constants, it is preferrable to use decibel literals instead. Example: auto db = -6_dB; Expression Semantics 0.0_dB Returns 0.0 dB. 0_dB Returns 0.0 dB. Take note that 0.0 and 0 stand for any floating point, and integer numeric literals.

Phase values run from 0 to 2π. The turn, also cycle, full circle, revolution, and rotation, is a complete circular movement or measure (as to return to the same point) with circle or ellipse. A turn is abbreviated τ, cyc, rev, or rot depending on the application. The symbol τ can also be used as a mathematical constant to represent 2π radians. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_unit phase is represented in a fixed-point 1.31 format where 31 bits are fractional. Such a format is perfectly suitable for oscillators. For that purpose, a phase accumulator can be used: essentially a counter that keeps track of the current phase value for the waveform. Initially, the accumulator is set to an arbitrary starting phase, usually 0. To generate the next sample of the waveform, we compute the phase value for the next sample based on the desired frequency and the sample rate. This value is then added to the current phase accumulator value. This process continues for each successive sample in the waveform. The advantage of using fixed point 1.31 to represent phase is that the phase accumulator inherently rewraps the value when the next phase exceeds 2π. This behavior is inherent to the fixed-point 1.31 format and eliminates the need for additional logic to handle the wraparound condition.
